{"name":"Gpu-blob-tracking","tagline":"Implementing video processing for blob tracking on the GPU.\t","body":"gpuTracker provides gpu accelerated blob tracking for multi touch user interfaces (and other blob tracking needs for that matter). Video signals are processed on the gpu to provide real time tracking of blobs. gpuTracker is aimed specifically at tracking blobs such as those created by multi touch displays using frustrated total internal reflection or diffused illumination.\r\n<br/>\r\nOriginally hosted [here](https://code.google.com/p/gputracker/)\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\n***\r\nGSoC 2008 project\r\n<br/>\r\n![GSoC 2008](http://db.tt/7q0G6unN)\r\n<br/>\r\n**Student:** Thomas Hansen\r\n<br/>\r\n**Mentor:** Mathieu Virbel","google":"UA-38848919-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
